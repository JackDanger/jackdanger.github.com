My wife sometimes threatens to quit her (psychology) career and open a car repair shop. She'd hire only women and service women's cars because she knows that she can take advantage of how much unreliability and apparent dishonesty there is in the field of car repair. For the layperson finding a mechanic is a crapshoot. They want a good one, they want their car fixed, but the skills required to fix their car are largely the same as those required to evaluate a repairperson.

Some mechanics start their careers as fifteen year olds spending Saturday afternoon under their truck. Or maybe their parent/grandparent taught them as a kid. But either way it started informally and with curiosity about how the engine and drivetrain system work. Some of these people grow up and claim to be professionals despite not expanding their knowledge beyond what they had as a teenager. Others mechanics begin their work inside formal training programs and, despite having a certificate, have such a shallow depth of knowledge that they'll likely be a dead weight at any garage where they work.




- how people think of mechanics (it's a crapshoot, I just want a good one)
- where mechanics come from
  - youthful hobbyists
  - technical-school-trained professionals

- you can't trust a hobbyist who hasn't been rigorously trained because they're only good at the kind of work they do in their free time.
- you can't trust a professional who isn't also a hobbyist because only through personal, emotional investment in a craft can you learn it deeply.
- how the search for a web developer and car mechanic looks identical to a client.
  - Everybody wants to recommend theirs when they find one.
- where web developers come from
  - hobbyists
  - technical schools, certification courses
- You REALLY can't trust someone who became a web developer through formal education.
  - They literally cannot make you a website.
- You will be frustrated with a hobbyist because everything you ask for will end up looking like the home page for a web hosting service.

- these two industries are almost identical

- you CAN find a good webdeveloper to implement your idea. Finding one is just like finding a mechanic:
- Good developers come with recommendations. It's not impolite to ask, if they don't have a stack of quote from people singing praises of the developer then they cannot build you a website.
- Good developers are able to show you their prior work. Don't judge it by quantity or aesthetic. Pay attention to whether the design seems to meet the business needs of the client.
- Good developers provide you with a (short term) schedule for the work. If they've done this before they'll know that they need to closely manage their design tasks.
- Good developers will charge more than you expect. You wouldn't let a $12/hr mechanic fix your BMW, don't let a $400 flat-rate developer make you a website. You will hate it and feel stupid.
- Good developers will help you clarify your needs. You don't need to know what brand of sparkplug best fits your car and you don't need to know whether your site is best modeled as a CMS, a blog, or a portfolio site.
