      <p>
        There is nourishment like bread<br/>
        that feeds one part of your life,<br/>
        nourishment like light for another.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are many rules about restraint<br/>
        with the former, but only one rule<br/>
        for the latter: <em>Never be satisfied.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Eat and drink the soul substance</br>
        as a wick does with the oil it soaks in.</br>
        Give light to all.
      </p>
